# LedgerJS Example App

This is a simple demo using LedgerJS to interact with a Nano Ledger S.

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

You must also install Bitcoin Test (BTC) via Ledger Live and create at least 1 account.
For that:

1. Go to `Settings`, `Experimental Features` and enable `Developer Mode`
2. Go to `Manager`
3. Install `Bitcoin Test (BTC)`
4. Make sure to terminate Ledger Live afterwards as only 1 app can connect to your Ledger at the same time.
5. Make sure to have at least 0.001 tBTC on your account (https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co)

## How To

Connect your ledger and start `Bitcoin Test (BTC)`.
